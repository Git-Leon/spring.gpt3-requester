# Spring Boot Project Template
* **Objective** - The purpose of this repository is to create a standard template to clone from when creating new spring boot projects.

## How to use
* To use this project as template, _clone_ the project into your `~/dev` directory,  
* Upon cloning reconfigure the remote by
    1. delete the `.git` folder associated with project.
    2. `git init` to create a new `.git` folder
    3. point the new `.git` folder to your new remote via `git remote set-url`.
* After reconfiguring remote, open the project in a text editor (VSCode, IntelliJ, SublimeText, Atom, etc.)
* Ensure that the `artifactId` of the project is changed from `spring-template-project` to a more appropriate project name.
* Click view the [`README-Sample.md`](./README-Sample.md) to view _how_ a `README` should be structured for a project.
